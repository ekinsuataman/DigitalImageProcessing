# DigitalImageProcessing
 
# Instructions

Coverage: You will practice image enhancement techniques in the spatial and frequency domain. You
may need several of the methods including point processing operations, histogram
processing, spatial filtering and noise removal.

Programming Language: MATLAB

Data: You are given the necessary image files here. Download and include them in your working
directory. Among these images, “original.tif” is the original image and it is just given for reference. You
will not use this image in your solutions. You will use one of the input images numbered from 0 to 1. You
have to use the image whose number is equal to the last digit of your student ID. (My studentID's last digit was 
2 so I picked 2nd picture from images folder)
